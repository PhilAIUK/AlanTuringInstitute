# **Question 1: What technical skills would you bring to the team?**

First of all, I have an engineer background in Electronics and Computers.
As you will be able to see from my LinkedIn profile, I started with experiences as an IT Consultant, doing software programmation and systems integration.
Then, I progressively moved into product marketing, partnerships, digital and payment solutions design, and business development.

More recently, I started a 12 months career break in order to develop my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

As for the 5 challenges that you are proposing for the April 2019 Data Study Groups, I have the following additional skills that would be very useful:
- NATS, Using real-world data to advance air traffic control:
  - I have a passion for aviation and got my PPL Pilot License in 2012
  - During my engineering programme (in 1993), I did an engineer internship at Thomson CSF company in France. My role was to design a new radar-control system, using fuzzy logic, in order to improve existing systems which determined planes trajectories based on radar plots.

- Spend Network, Automated matching of business to government contract opportunities: 
  - In my various business experiences, I had to respond to multiple tenders and win contracts. These tenders were in Europe and in the UK (eg. in the Transports and Retail sectors).
  - In the Coursera Machine Learning course, I learnt more about unsupervised/supervised/semi-supervised learning, recommender systems, structured and unstructured data, and text mining (e.g. email spam)
  - At Worldline, I designed Natural Language Processing tools and worked with our technical teams to implement them in the transport sector (e.g. Chatbot, Alexa skill, Google Home actions)0
  Our RedSpottedHanky Alexa Skill has been shortlisted as a finalist in the Digital Pioneer category at the [2018 UK Rail Industry Awards](http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/ukria/shortlist/2018) 

# **Question 2: What collaborative skills would you bring to the team?**

The Data Study Group team would certainly benefit from having me there for the following reasons:
- I have a true collaborative spirit in everything I do, and always enjoyed working in groups
- I strongly believe that we progress quicker and better when we work in partnerships with a true "win-win" spirit. I have always applied it during my personal and professional life (e.g. British Airways and SUN below).
- I am a good listener, curious and like to think out of the box. In February 2019, I visited the first Excellence Centre of Artificial Intelligence in Colombia (in Medellin) and learnt a lot from the discussions I had with some of its leaders. On that note, I would be happy to introduce you to them if you wish to share knowledge.
- I have several examples where I had to solve problems and deliver results with teams in few days (see below)
- Although I have less technical knowledge than several PhD students or Data Science experts, I will also bring to the team my business insights, more than 25 years of business experience in developing and selling digital/innovative solutions, and a strong motivation to learn from the team and apply my recent knowledge in AI, ML and Data Science into a practical case
- My full disponibility and commitment in the project. I have already ensured that I will not have any personal constraints during those 5 days so that it will not impact the team.

Here are some examples to demonstrate my experience in working in groups, and how the teams and myself have mutually benefited from working together:
1. HEC MBA (16 months)
 - During my MBA, I constantly worked in groups of 4-5 people where we had to solve problems and deliver results within a very short timeframe.
 - Groups were composed of people from various cultures (80% foreigners) and backgrounds (technical, HR, military, public sector, artists, marketing, sales, finance...). On one hand, it added complexity to the interaction. On the other hand, it help each of the participants to bring their own contribution and knowledge to the team.
2. In most of my career, I worked in matrix-based organisations. This means that I only had few direct reports and always needed to convince senior executives to allocate resources from different teams to my projects.
 - To make it successful, I always identified what the benefits would be for each team members, and ensured everyone was aligned with the objectives and enjoying the journey.
 - As for my direct reports, I always ensured that we built a positive team spirit, met regularly to check progress against objectives, provided advices and coaching, and had fun working together.
3. Worldline
 - Quite often, I had to quickly develop prototypes in order to demonstrate value to clients, and work in teams to make it happen
 - An example is an Alexa Skill proof-of-concept I worked on with Worldline colleagues (based in India and UK) for Cineworld. The team and I were really proud of having designed and implemented a working prototype in only 4 days
 - With the same client, I have also organised a full-day Hackathon where we worked in teams to solve the following challenge: identify how we can help grow the Cineworld Unlimited customer base faster. It is another example where I had to solve problems in a very short time, working in collaboration with known and unknown team members.
4. American Express
 - In 2005, I joined American Express to launch, own and grow the British Airways American Express Corporate Card programme.
 - As such, I led the discussions with our partner British Airways related to all product and marketing decisions. I also needed to team up with our marketing, acquisition, finance teams, and external communication agencies.
 - During these 4.5 years, I built a very robust relationship with our partner and teams, based on trust and fun (team-building events, driving some new and innovative marketing campaigns...). This led to the co-brand product being one of the most successful at American Express.
5. Siemens Mobile Phones
 - Prior to launching the first Java-Enabled mobile phone in Europe (Siemens M45), I realised that it was difficult to convince network operators to buy this product with a premium without content (there were no Java application available to download on the phone).
 - I got the idea to set up and launch the first application contest for Java mobile phones. For this, I engaged:
   - Engineering schools to get their engineers develop java-mobile applications
   - Initiated a partnership with SUN Microsystems, owner of the Java technology, to help promote the application contest and get funding
   - Liaised with book editors, to spread the knowledge of Siemens Java APIs
   - Invited French network operators to be part of the jury to select the best applications
   - Siemens product team and engineers (based in Munich) to prepare the Software Development Toolkit that will be used by engineers
 - I worked in collaboration with all these stakeholders presenting my idea as a true win-win initiative:
   - SUN found the opportunity to educate on the new java-mobile technology much faster
   - Engineering schools found a way to motivate their students with a real industrial project. Some even created a dedicated elective course for it
   - Some engineers later created their own startup on java applications, leveraging their experience from that competition
   - Network operators could clearly see the benefits of enabling application downloads on mobile phones (iPhone did not exist yet)
   - As for Siemens, it has been a huge success. I secured thousands of sales of the new M45 phones with network operators, got a chapter of a java-mobile book dedicated to Siemens APIs, and worked with Siemens HQ in Munich to deploy similar initiatives worldwide

# **Question 3: What do you hope to personally achieve through your participation in the Data Study Group?**

I recently started a 12 months career break in order to develop my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

What I would personally achieve through the Data Study Group is:
- Apply the knowledge I recently acquired in AI, ML, and Data Science to a practical industry case
- Experience how technical experts develop and implement AI and Data Science solutions, their process and way of thinking
- Challenge myself
- Identify my knowledge gaps and help me define what I need to learn next (in April, I would still have 6 months left in my career break)
- Make this opportunity the starting point of a long-term and strong collaboration with the Alan Turing Institute. I am already a member of the British Library and I have attended some of the Alan Turing Institute events. I am looking forward to being even more engaged with you, including after my career break.
- My main career objective is to acquire enough technical skills to enable me to identify new business opportunities in AI, understand their feasibility and ROI potential, and collaborate efficiently with data scientists and AI developpers to implement them. The Data Study Groups will strongly contribute to that knowledge
